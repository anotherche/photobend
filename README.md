This is a Maven project implementing an ImageJ plugin providing trackig of 
a needle-like crystal shape changing during photobending process.
Photobending is a phenomenon of crystal deformation caused by non-uniform 
crystal structure transformation due to photochemical reaction. 

Required input is a stack of timelapse images taken during a photobending process.
The output is the time dependence of crystal's curvature and longotudinal deformation.
The project uses ideas and code of 
1. Template Matching by Qingzong Tseng (based on opencv)
2. Exif Metadata Library by Drew Noakes
